# Melbourne Parking Meters Data Visualization

**FIT3179 Data Visualisation 2 - Assignment**  
Monash University | Semester 2, 2025

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive data visualization exploring Melbourne's parking meter infrastructure, analyzing over 2,200 parking meters across Victoria. The visualization reveals patterns in pricing, occupancy rates, technology adoption, and maintenance status.

## 🎯 Domain & Purpose

**Domain:** Urban Infrastructure & Transportation  
**Target Audience:** Average Australian citizen, urban planners, local government officials  
**Purpose:** To provide insights into parking infrastructure efficiency, revenue patterns, and technology adoption across Melbourne's suburbs

## 🗺️ Visualizations

### Maps (2)
1. **Parking Meter Locations Map** - Interactive point map showing all meters color-coded by occupancy percentage
2. **Revenue by Council Area** - Aggregated visualization showing revenue performance across jurisdictions

### Charts (6)
3. **Parking Rates by Zone Type** - Bar chart comparing average hourly rates
4. **Occupancy vs Distance to CBD** - Scatter plot with regression line
5. **Payment Technology Distribution** - Donut chart showing feature adoption
6. **Maintenance Status Heatmap** - Temporal analysis of maintenance patterns
7. **Zone Type Composition** - Stacked bars showing meter types by suburb
8. **Revenue Distribution** - Box plot analysis by rate category

## 🎨 Design Features

### Typography
- **Display Font:** Playfair Display (headings) - elegant, high-contrast serif
- **Body Font:** Inter (content) - clean, modern sans-serif
- **Font Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between titles, subtitles, and body text

### Layout & Color
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly, single-page scrolling layout
- **Color Scheme:** Professional gradient hero (purple), with data-driven color scales
- **White Space:** Generous padding and margins for readability
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear sectioning with alternating backgrounds

### Interactive Elements
- Tooltips on all visualizations
- Hover effects on stat cards
- Smooth scrolling experience
- Export functionality for all charts

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **Location Impact:** CBD meters show 30-50% higher occupancy than outer suburbs
2. **Technology Adoption:** 80%+ meters support tap-to-pay payments
3. **Maintenance Patterns:** Pre-2010 meters require systematic upgrades
4. **Pricing Strategy:** Smart meters command premium rates
5. **Distance Correlation:** Clear negative relationship between CBD distance and occupancy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Vega-Lite v5** - Declarative visualization grammar
- **Pure.css** - Minimal CSS framework for layout
- **Google Fonts** - Custom typography (Inter + Playfair Display)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Lightweight embedding
